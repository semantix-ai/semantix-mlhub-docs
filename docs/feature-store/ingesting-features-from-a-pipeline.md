# Ingesting Features From a Pipeline Tool

In Semantix ML Hub, we offer flexibility in ingesting features into our feature store, allowing you to seamlessly integrate data from your preferred pipeline tools. Here's how you can ingest features from a pipeline tool:

1. **Utilize Your Pipeline Tool:**
   - First, use your preferred pipeline tool to create a dataframe containing the relevant features for your machine learning project. This pipeline tool can be any software or system you prefer to work with, ensuring that it aligns with your data processing needs.

2. **Integration with Our SDK:**
   - Once you have your dataframe with features ready, leverage our Software Development Kit (SDK) to ingest this data into our feature store. Our SDK serves as a powerful tool for interacting with Semantix ML Hub's features and capabilities.

3. **Ingest Data:**
   - Using the SDK, you can initiate the ingestion process, transferring the data from your pipeline tool's dataframe into our feature store seamlessly. The SDK provides the necessary functions and methods to facilitate this integration effortlessly.

By following these steps, you can efficiently incorporate features from your pipeline tool into our feature store, ensuring that your data is readily available for training machine learning models, conducting analyses, and driving insights. This seamless integration enhances your data science workflow, allowing you to make the most of Semantix ML Hub's feature management capabilities.
