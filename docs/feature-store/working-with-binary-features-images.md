# Working with Binary Features (Images)

In Semantix ML Hub, we offer seamless support for working with binary features, particularly images, within your data. Our system is designed to identify and handle image data present in the dataframe schema defined by the user. Here's how it works:

### Automatic Image Handling:

1. **DataFrame Schema Analysis:**
   - When you define a dataframe schema, Semantix ML Hub's system automatically analyzes it to identify any binary features that contain image data.

2. **Image Detection:**
   - Our system recognizes binary features that represent images based on their data type and structure within the schema.

3. **Image Download and Storage:**
   - Upon detecting image data, our SDK takes care of downloading and saving these images, ensuring that they are readily accessible for further analysis or processing.

### Benefits:

- **Effortless Image Integration:** You don't need to worry about manually handling image data within your dataframes. Our system automatically identifies and manages image features, simplifying the data preparation process.

- **Image Accessibility:** The downloaded images are easily accessible through our SDK, allowing you to access and work with them as needed for your machine learning tasks.

- **Streamlined Workflow:** By automating the handling of binary features like images, Semantix ML Hub enhances the efficiency of your data science workflow, enabling you to focus on building and training your machine learning models.

Working with binary features, especially images, becomes a seamless part of your data preparation and analysis process within Semantix ML Hub. Our system's automatic recognition and management of image data ensure that you can leverage image features effortlessly in your machine learning projects.
