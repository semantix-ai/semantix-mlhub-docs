# Creating a Feature Table

In Semantix ML Hub, creating a **Feature Table** is a fundamental step in organizing and managing your data for machine learning. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Feature Table. Follow these steps to get started:

**1. Name Your Feature Table**

Start by giving your Feature Table a meaningful name that reflects the purpose or content of the table. This name will help you identify and locate your Feature Table easily within the platform.

**2. Define Your Business Entities**

Business Entities are critical components of your Feature Table, as they define how data is organized and linked. For each Business Entity, specify the following:

- **Entity Name**: Provide a name that represents the type of entity, such as "Customer" or "Product."
- **Identifier**: Define an identifier for the entity. This identifier is used to uniquely identify records within the entity.
- **Type**: Indicate the data type of the identifier, which could be string, integer, float, or another appropriate type.

**3. Define Your Feature Collection**

Features are the data attributes or characteristics that you want to include in your Feature Table. For each feature, provide the following information:

- **Feature Name**: Name your feature descriptively to convey its purpose or content.
- **Type**: Specify the data type of the feature, such as integer, float, or categorical.
- **Add more Features if necessary**: Depending on your project requirements, add all the relevant features to the Feature Table.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully created a Feature Table in Semantix ML Hub. This Feature Table will serve as a structured repository for your data assets, making it easier to manage and utilize features for machine learning tasks. Now that you have your Feature Table ready, you can proceed with ingesting data and working with features for your projects.
