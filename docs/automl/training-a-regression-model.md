# Training a Regression Model

In Semantix ML Hub, we provide a comprehensive solution for training regression models, simplifying the process of finding the best pipeline for your regression tasks. Our system combines three key components: automatic pipeline selection, feature selection, and model selection, all guided by a scoring function optimized for your project's objectives.

### Key Components:

1. **Automatic Pipeline Selection:**
   - Our platform automatically identifies the best pipeline, which includes data preprocessing steps and the machine learning model, tailored to your regression task.

2. **Auto Feature Selection:**
   - Feature selection is crucial for model performance. We employ Genetic Algorithms to efficiently select the most relevant features based on your specified scoring function and the desired number of features.

3. **Auto Model Selection (TPOT):**
   - We leverage the TPOT package to find the best combination of preprocessing and machine learning models for your regression task. TPOT optimizes these combinations based on the scoring function you define.

4. **SDK Integration:**
   - We provide an SDK client that serves as a convenient wrapper for our backend API. This client enables you to run AutoML jobs, list job history, and access specific job details easily.

### Arguments Needed for Running an AutoML Job:

When running an AutoML job for regression model training, you'll need to provide the following essential arguments:

- `feature_table_name`: The name of the feature table used for feature loading.
- `target_name`: The name of the target variable you want to predict.
- `id_column`: The name of the column containing unique identifiers in your dataframe.
- `features_selected`: A subset of features to select from the feature table.
- `start_date`: The date from which to load the features until the present date.
- `end_date`: The date until which to load the features.
- `task`: Specify that this is a regression task.
- `scoring`: Define the scoring function to use for evaluation. The scoring function may vary depending on your specific regression task.
- `num_features`: Specify the final number of features you want in the model.
- `generations`: The number of runs the Genetic Algorithm will perform before completing the optimization process.

### Benefits:

- **Efficiency:** Automate the entire process of regression model development, from preprocessing to model selection, saving you time and effort.

- **Customization:** Tailor the feature selection, model selection, and scoring function to meet the unique requirements of your regression task.

- **Performance Optimization:** The system optimizes your pipeline, ensuring that it delivers the best possible results for regression.

- **Objective-Driven:** Create regression models that align with your project's specific goals and metrics.

Semantix ML Hub's AutoML for regression models streamlines the process of building high-performing models for regression tasks. This integrated solution allows you to focus on extracting valuable insights from your data, knowing that your regression model is optimized for success.
