# Using AutoML via the SDK

Semantix ML Hub provides a user-friendly SDK (Software Development Kit) that simplifies the process of leveraging our AutoML capabilities. This SDK serves as a convenient wrapper for our backend API, offering you the flexibility and control to run AutoML jobs, manage your job history, and retrieve specific job details with ease.

### Key Features:

1. **Run AutoML Jobs:**
   - The SDK allows you to initiate and execute AutoML jobs effortlessly. You can define your job parameters, including the feature table, target variable, and other essential settings.

2. **List Job History:**
   - Gain visibility into your past AutoML jobs. The SDK enables you to view a list of all the jobs you've executed, providing valuable insights into your workflow.

3. **Retrieve Job Details:**
   - Access specific job details for in-depth analysis. You can retrieve information about a particular job, including its status, results, and configuration.

### How to Use the SDK:

To utilize the SDK effectively, you can perform the following actions:

1. **Run an AutoML Job:**
   - Use the SDK to define the parameters for your AutoML job, including the feature table, target variable, task type (classification or regression), scoring function, and more. The SDK will handle the execution of the job on our platform.

2. **List Job History:**
   - Access a comprehensive list of all the AutoML jobs you've previously executed. This feature provides a historical overview of your modeling efforts.

3. **Retrieve Job Details:**
   - Dive deeper into a specific AutoML job by retrieving its details. You can review the job's status, the selected pipeline, feature selection results, and other relevant information.

By utilizing the SDK, you streamline your interaction with Semantix ML Hub's AutoML capabilities. It's a powerful tool that empowers you to manage your machine learning tasks efficiently, from job initiation to result analysis.

Whether you're a data scientist looking to automate your model development process or an AI enthusiast exploring the possibilities of AutoML, our SDK simplifies the experience, allowing you to focus on deriving valuable insights from your data.
