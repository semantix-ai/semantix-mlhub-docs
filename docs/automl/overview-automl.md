# Overview

Welcome to the **AutoML** feature of **Semantix ML Hub**. This section provides an overview of our comprehensive AutoML solution, designed to simplify and accelerate your machine learning model development process.

## What is AutoML in Semantix ML Hub?

AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, is a feature that automates the process of training machine learning models. With Semantix ML Hub's AutoML, you can easily select features, set your target variable, define the task type, and specify metrics. Once configured, you simply press a button and wait for your model to be trained.

## Key Features

1. **Feature Selection**: Seamlessly pick and choose features from our feature store.
2. **Task Configuration**: Specify whether you're working on a Classification or Regression task.
3. **Metrics Selection**: Define the metrics that matter most to your model's performance.
4. **One-Click Training**: With all parameters set, just press a button to start the training process.
5. **Results Review**: Once training is complete, you can instantly view the results and performance of your model.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using AutoML

1. **AutoML Start Page**:
    - Start by clicking on the AutoML button on the bar in the left of the initial page. ![automl_initial](/img/automl_initial.png)

2. **Select Features**:
    - Select the Feature Table that you want to load data for training.
    - Browse and select the features you want to include in your model.
    - Click on 'Add to Model'.
3. **Configure Model**:
    - Set your target variable by selecting the relevant column name.
    - Choose the type of task: 'Classification' or 'Regression'.
    - Select the metrics you want to evaluate your model on, such as accuracy, precision, or RMSE.
4. **Start Training**:
    - Once you've configured your model, click on the 'Train Model' button.
    - A progress bar will appear, showing the status of the training process.
5. **Review Results**:
    - After training is complete, navigate to the 'Results' tab.
    - Here, you can view detailed metrics and performance indicators of your trained model.

## Conclusion

AutoML in Semantix ML Hub is designed to make machine learning model development as straightforward and efficient as possible. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, our platform provides the tools you need to develop and publish models with ease.

Remember, if you prefer coding, Semantix ML Hub also offers a Python SDK for a more hands-on approach. Happy modeling!
